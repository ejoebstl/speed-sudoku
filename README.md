# speed-sudoku

Who can code the fastest Sudoku solver (in c++ 14)?

## Workflow

Branch the repository, build your own solver (```solver\_USERNAME.hpp```), and then create a pull request. 

You can use the solver template (```solver.hpp```). Input/output format is also explained there.  

## Benchmarking

Tests will run on commoditiy hardware using 4 GB of RAM and an Intel i5 processor with four cores. 

We will publish the ranking here.
